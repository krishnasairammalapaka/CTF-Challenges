        <h1>Basic SQL Injection Challenge</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>A small web application has a login page that is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
        <p>The flag is stored in the database under the admin account. Your objective is to bypass the authentication by exploiting this vulnerability.</p>
        <p>For example, try entering the following payload in the username field:</p>
        <pre>admin' OR '1'='1</pre>
        <p>Leave the password field as is (or provide any value) to successfully log in and retrieve the flag from the admin account's details.</p>
        <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Understand how SQL injection can bypass authentication. A simple approach is to inject a condition that always evaluates to true.</p>
